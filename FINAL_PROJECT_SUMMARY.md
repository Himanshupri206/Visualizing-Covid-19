### 2. Code Structure Improvement
The original monolithic script was refactored into a modular architecture:

- **[data_fetcher.py](file:///c%3A/Users/adnan/Desktop/Projects/Visualizing%20Covid-19/data_fetcher.py)**: Handles data fetching and filtering operations
- **[data_processor.py](file:///c%3A/Users/adnan/Desktop/Projects/Visualizing%20Covid-19/data_processor.py)**: Contains data processing functions
- **[visualizer.py](file:///c%3A/Users/adnan/Desktop/Projects/Visualizing%20Covid-19/visualizer.py)**: Manages visualization generation
- **[config.py](file:///c%3A/Users/adnan/Desktop/Projects/Visualizing%20Covid-19/config.py)**: Centralized configuration management
- **[covid_visualization.py](file:///c%3A/Users/adnan/Desktop/Projects/Visualizing%20Covid-19/covid_visualization.py)**: Main application orchestrator

### 3. Enhanced Visualization Strategy
- **Additional Chart Types**: Expanded to include scatter plots and stacked area charts
- **Improved Visualizations**: Enhanced styling and consistency across all charts
- **Export Functionality**: Charts can be saved and shared

### 4. Interactive Dashboard
- **[dashboard.py](file:///c%3A/Users/adnan/Desktop/Projects/Visualizing%20Covid-19/dashboard.py)**: Interactive web-based dashboard using Streamlit (implementation ready)
- Features include:
  - Real-time data fetching
  - Interactive filters for date ranges and continents
  - Multiple visualization types in a single interface
  - Data explorer with download capability

### 5. Technical Improvements
- **Requirements Management**: [requirements.txt](file:///c%3A/Users/adnan/Desktop/Projects/Visualizing%20Covid-19/requirements.txt) for dependency management
- **Configuration Management**: Externalized configuration for flexibility
- **Responsive Design**: Consistent styling that works across different screen sizes

## How to Use

### Installation
1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Visualizations
1. Generate static visualizations:
   ```bash
   python covid_visualization.py
   ```

2. Run the interactive dashboard (when Streamlit is properly installed):
   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```

## Key Features Implemented

### Modular Architecture
The project now follows a clean, modular architecture that separates concerns:
- Data fetching is handled by [data_fetcher.py](file:///c%3A/Users/adnan/Desktop/Projects/Visualizing%20Covid-19/data_fetcher.py)
- Data processing is handled by [data_processor.py](file:///c%3A/Users/adnan/Desktop/Projects/Visualizing%20Covid-19/data_processor.py)
- Visualization generation is handled by [visualizer.py](file:///c%3A/Users/adnan/Desktop/Projects/Visualizing%20Covid-19/visualizer.py)
- Configuration is managed by [config.py](file:///c%3A/Users/adnan/Desktop/Projects/Visualizing%20Covid-19/config.py)

### Enhanced Visualizations
The project now generates multiple types of visualizations:
1. Bar charts showing average deaths per million by continent
2. Line charts comparing smoothed new cases between regions
3. Scatter plots comparing vaccination rates vs. death rates
4. Stacked area charts for case progression by continent

### Interactive Dashboard
The interactive dashboard provides:
- Real-time data exploration
- Customizable filters
- Multiple visualization types
- Data export capabilities

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
